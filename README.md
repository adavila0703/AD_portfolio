# Side Scrolling Action
Below is my version of a sprint and double jump mechanic in a side-scroller in UE4, located in sidescrolling_actionCharacter.cpp. I also some foliage and a character from the free section of the UE4 marketplace.

# EE Calculator
This small command prompt program is a house for all Electrical Engineering and physics formulas. You will be able to calculate everything from Ohm's law to complex nodal analysis on a circuit board.

Below is a picture of current menu screen. Currently you can evaluate:

  * Ohm's Law
  
The basics of Electrical Engineering, these simple equations can help you analyze just about anything once you understand all component concepts. But having a calculator for it is just plain cool.

 * Capacitor Charge Up
 
The capacitor charge up function allows you to input voltage, capacitance, resistance, and it will output your total energy used with the charge up time constant.

This still needs work on calculating voltage at a specific time, but when its done you will be able to calculate all voltage times with an array.

# In progress for EE Calc.

# Door Game

This is a fun little game where you have to choose a door, fight enemies and try to get passed 4 doors.


# Angels Course Project
For one of my CS course projects, I started working on an inventory system with an account registering and login system, which demonstrates reading and writing data.
